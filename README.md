You will need to spin up the backend to this project which can also be found in my GitHub account.

## Registration

If you are a project manager, register and create an account. As a client, you should have received an invite link from your assigned PM to register for RevCount.

## Dashboard

![Dashboard](/images/project/Dashboard.png)

Once logged in, you will see a rendered list of all available projects. If you would like to invite clients to join new Projects (as a project manager), please refer to the dashboard menu on the left side of the screen, where you could choose between sending clients an invitation e-mail or creating a new project with an existing client account.

## Revisions

![Revisions](/images/project/Revisions.png)

When an active project is chosen, you would see a list of all current revisions. Both parties will be notified via email if the max-revision limit is met. Here you can manager all of your project revisions and select a specific revision to view.

## Updating revisions

When in the revision view, you could leave comments and attach other data (which is stored in Amazon S3). This is also where you can mark revisions as done and keep all communications about a specific revision with the client/project manager.
